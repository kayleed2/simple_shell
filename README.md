# Recreating a Simple Shell in C Language

## The Project
This project is a creation of a simple UNIX command interpreter using
the C programming language.

## Use
This simple shell can be used similarly to a standard UNIX shell.
It is a command-line interpreter that provides a command line user
interface for interacting with the operating system.

## Get Started
To use this simple shell program, simply run ./hsh on the command line.
This will open up the recreated shell and can be used similarly to a
standard UNIX shell.

##Creators
This project was contributed to, and maintained, by Kaylee Dao and
Adam Clear.
