# Recreating a Simple Shell in C Language

## The Project
This project is a creation of a simple UNIX command interpreter using
the C programming language.

###### Use
This simple shell can be used similarly to a standard UNIX shell.
It is a command-line interpreter that provides a command line user
interface for interacting with the operating system.

###### Get Started
To use this simple shell program, simply run ./hsh on the command line.
This will open up the recreated shell and can be used similarly to a
standard UNIX shell.

###### Examples
Launch the shell with ./hsh

Once launched, use the ls command to list all the files in the current dir.
	For instance, once you type ls, the terminal will display all the files in
	the current directory, like so;

	AUTHORS          _itoa.c     _spec_di.c   _strcat.c  _strncmp.c  man_1_simple_shell
	README.md        _printf.c   _spec_pct.c  _strcmp.c  error.c     pathfinder.c
	_chardup.c       _putchar.c  _spec_r.c    _strcpy.c  execute.c   printenv.c
	_get_function.c  _spec_b.c   _spec_rot.c  _strdup.c  header.h    splitter.c
	_getenv.c        _spec_c.c   _spec_s.c    _strlen.c  main.c

Or try env to print the current environment.

The exit command will safely terminate the shell.
