# Recreating a Simple Shell in C Language

## The Project
This project is a creation of a simple UNIX command interpreter using
the C programming language.

###### Use
This simple shell can be used similarly to a standard UNIX shell.
It is a command-line interpreter that provides a command line user
interface for interacting with the operating system.

###### Get Started
To use this simple shell program, simply run ./hsh on the command line.
This will open up the recreated shell and can be used similarly to a
standard UNIX shell.

###### Examples
Launch the shell with ./hsh

Once launched, use the ls command to list all the files in the current dir.

Or try env to print the current environment.

The exit command will safely terminate the shell.
